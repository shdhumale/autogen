Autogen
Automated Code Generation Framework
Autogen is a powerful and flexible framework designed to automate the generation of code, configurations, and boilerplate for various programming languages and project types. It aims to streamline development workflows, reduce manual errors, and accelerate the creation of new projects or features by providing a customizable and extensible generation engine.

‚ú® Features
Template-Driven Generation: Utilize predefined or custom templates to generate code based on your specifications.

Language Agnostic: Supports generation for multiple programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, C#) and file formats (e.g., JSON, YAML, XML).

Configurable Inputs: Define inputs through configuration files (e.g., JSON, YAML) or command-line arguments to drive the generation process.

Extensible Architecture: Easily add new templates, generators, or custom logic to suit unique project requirements.

Boilerplate Reduction: Automate the creation of common project structures, API endpoints, database models, and more.

CLI Interface: Simple command-line interface for quick and efficient code generation.
